# Road Map

## Future Spark Development Ideas

1. Mobile optimization
2. Photo login to verify identity
3. Get location data from Facebook and add to matches profile
4. Messaging between users within the app to avoid sharing private emails
5. Adding additional personality tests to further refine the matches
6. Recommend books, movies, date nights and activities based on mutual interests of a specific match.
7. Link to Fandango or restaurant bookings and design dates tailored to the pair.
8. "Passport" picture (i.e., make everyone use the same type of picture so it's not just about looks).
